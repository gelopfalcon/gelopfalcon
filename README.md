### Hola Mundo 👋
My name is Gerardo López Falcón, I'm from a beautiful country named Costa Rica. I'm a Senior Software Engineer | SRE | DevOps. Fan of web and cloud technologies. Google Cloud expert in [GDG Pura vida](https://twitter.com/gdgpuravida) & Community Leader in [Docker Costa Rica](https://twitter.com/DockerTico). :rocket:

🔭 I’m currently working on migrating and innovating projects to cloud (Google Cloud and AWS). 


🌱 I’m looking to collaborate on companies that want to migrate to the cloud carrying its business to another level. But my most motivation and passion is to help others, it is the reason why I learn things because I love teaching, I like thinking that I could improve other lives. Regularly I write blog posts and made videos in order to share my experiences and knowledge with others, I don't get any money for doing that, all is the passion by teaching.
